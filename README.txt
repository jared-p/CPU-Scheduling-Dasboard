This is a visual dasboard for introductory CPU scheduling algorithms including First Come First Serve, Round Robin, Rate Monotonic, and Earliest Deadline First. User can input up to four tasks, each task having an execution time, period, and release time. The dashboard assumes each task is predictably periodic after the initial release.

The code is modular and dynamically generated, it can be updated to include additional tasks with minimal work.
